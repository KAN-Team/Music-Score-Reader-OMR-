function fixed_image = HandleRotation(gray_image)
    %{
      HANDLE_ROTATION Gets a rotated image and corrects it.
        If the image is in it's normal orientation it returns the original
        image.
        
        Radon transform projections along 180 degrees, from -90 to +89....
        R: Radon transform of the intensity image 'grayImage' for -90:89 degrees.
        In fact, each column of R shows the image profile along corresponding angle. 
        xp: a vector containing the radial coordinates corresponding to each row of 'R'.
        Negative angles correspond to clockwise directions, while positive angles
        correspond to counterclockwise directions around the center point (up-left corner).
        R1: A 1x180 vector in which, each element is equal the maximum value of Radon transform along each angle.
        This value reflects the maximum number of pixels along each direction. 
        r_max: A 1x180 vector, which includes corresponding radii of 'R1'.
        
        In Line detection section it performs a Hough-like search. 
        It finds maximum value of Radon transform over all radii and 
        angles in angles greater than 50 or= less than -50. First detected 
        angle indicates the slope of the upper bond of the image. 
        
        [N.B] This pice of code was introduced by Amir Omidvarnia
        in "Image Rotation Correction" at MATLAB Central File Exchange.
